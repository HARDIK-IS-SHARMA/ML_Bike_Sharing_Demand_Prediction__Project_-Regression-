# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction_Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the demand for bikes in a bike sharing system. Accurately forecasting bike demand can help optimize inventory and pricing strategies for bike rental companies. In this project, we develop a regression supervised machine learning model to predict bike demand in a given time period.

## Objective 

My goal is to develop a model that is highly accurate, with a low mean absolute error and a high R-squared value. The model should also be able to provide insights into the factors that most impact bike demand, helping the bike sharing company to make data-driven decisions about how to optimize their operations.

## Approach
The following steps were followed in the project:

### Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data and EDA is performed to find the relation between each column , its a very crucial step and done with perfection.

### Data Split: The preprocessed data was split into training and test sets. The training set was used to train our machine learning model, while the test set was used for evaluation.

### Model Training: Several different machine learning model architectures and hyperparameter settings were experimented with. The models were trained using the training data, and their performances were evaluated using various metrics.

### Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. The model that performed the best on the test data was selected.

### Feature Importance: Ablation studies were conducted to understand the impact of individual features on the model's performance. The analysis revealed the significance of temperature, weather conditions, and seasonality features in predicting bike demand.
